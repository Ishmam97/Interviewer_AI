# CLAUDE.md

Operating contract for this scaffold — objective rules for Claude Code, not prose for human readers. The full map of agents, commands, skills, hooks, and templates is in **`.claude/INDEX.md`**; consult it to pick a tool. Project-specific facts live in **§ Project context** below, populated per project — the scaffold core stays stable.
Toolkit, not pipeline: invoke what the work needs. The pieces compose; there is no enforced order.
## Project context
**Interviewer AI** — a full-stack web app for AI-driven mock interviews. Users upload a resume and job description, then conduct an interactive interview session where AI generates context-aware questions, scores answers in real time, and produces a comprehensive performance report.
Live demo: https://interviewerai-ishmamdemo.streamlit.app/
### Stack

| Frontend | React + Vite + TypeScript SPA, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python), single `server.py` with all routes |
| Auth | Firebase Auth (email/password + Google OAuth) |
| Database | Firestore (profiles, user_settings, interview_sessions, interview_reports, dream_jobs) |
| AI | OpenAI-compatible API via AIML API (`OPENAI_BASE_URL` configurable); LangGraph workflow |
| Embeddings/RAG | FAISS + `text-embedding-3-small`; vector index persisted via Docker volume |
| Containers | Docker + docker-compose (frontend on :8080, backend on :8000) |

### Key implementation facts
- **Auth**: all routes do real Firebase ID token verification via `FirebaseManager.verify_id_token()`; the old `dummy-token` dev bypass described in older docs **does not exist in current code**. Use `/test/interview/start` and `/test/interview/answer` for auth-free dev testing
- **Session cache**: active sessions live in `_active_sessions` dict in `server.py`; synced to Firestore before caching; if absent from cache `_reconstruct_session()` rebuilds from Firestore (FAISS index lost on reconstruction)
- **Frontend routing**: ALL navigation is `activeSection` state in `Index.tsx` — not URL-based; React Router only handles root and 404
- **Multi-resume**: users can store multiple analyzed resumes; one is flagged `active`
- **Dream Job feature**: 2-pass async pipeline — Pass 1: `gpt-5-nano` normalizes JD; Pass 2: Kimi LLM runs fit analysis; status polled every 2s from frontend
- **Route prefix**: all routes use bare paths (`/interview/start`, not `/api/v1/interview/start`) — docs may say otherwise, code wins
- **Service account**: `backend-microservice/firebase-service-account.json` must exist; never committed; falls back to Application Default Credentials
- `database/supabase.py` exists but is **unused** — leftover from an earlier design
### Firebase project
- Project ID: `interviewer-ea164`
- authDomain: `interviewer-ea164.firebaseapp.com`
- appId: `1:452095792083:web:3337139b726fa56164d526`
### Firestore collections
| Collection | Doc ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `profiles` | Firebase UID | User profile |
| `user_settings` | Firebase UID | Model/interview config |
| `interview_sessions` | auto | Session state, history, scores, report |
| `interview_reports` | auto | Completed report records |
| `dream_jobs` | auto | Dream Job fit analyses |
| `resume_parsed_sections` | analysis_id | Parsed resume sections (step 1) |
### Known gaps / tech debt
- No `/api/v1` prefix despite some docs suggesting it — pick a convention before exposing a public API
- `supabase.py` is dead code — remove
- In-memory session cache lost on pod restart; FAISS not reconstructable from Firestore
- `BackgroundTasks` is not durable — use Celery + Redis for production retry/monitoring
- No pagination on `/interview/sessions`
- `API_TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md` references Supabase (stale — project uses Firebase)
- Unique constraint on `(user_id, session_id)` missing in `interview_reports`
## Operating principles
1. **Typed artifacts beat chat.** Planning outputs go in `docs/<type>/<slug>.md`, generated from `templates/`. Artifacts are the handoff medium between agents and survive context resets.
2. **Architect → Editor split.** Non-trivial implementation uses a high-reasoning architect to plan against a story, then an implementer to apply diffs. `/implement` orchestrates this.
3. **Stories are self-contained.** Each story embeds its slice of architecture, acceptance criteria, and relevant repo-map references — enough that any agent can pick it up cold.
4. **Brownfield starts with the repo map.** Run `/brownfield:onboard` once per repo to seed `REPOMAP.md`. Other agents reference it instead of re-deriving structure.
5. **Reviews fan out in parallel.** `/review` invokes `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `perf-auditor` concurrently. Aggregate findings by severity, not by reviewer.
6. **Right-size the work.** Match artifact depth to scope. The complexity determines the depth, not a fixed pipeline.
   | Scope | Use | Example |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Small** (≤3 files, ≤1 hour, one clear change) | Skip PRD/architect. `/brownfield:bugfix` or direct edit. Emit a 3-line inline plan before the first edit. | Fix a null-pointer in `parseConfig`. |
   | **Medium** (one story file, half-day to two days) | `/story` then `/implement`. | Add an endpoint and its tests. |
   | **Large** (multiple stories, requires design) | Full PRD → architecture → stories → `/implement` per story. | New feature surface. |
   | **Complex** (cross-system, high uncertainty) | Add `/challenge` between architecture and stories. Spike if novel. | Migration touching writers and readers; new auth model. 
   | **Safety valve:** if a "small" task reveals more than 5 atomic steps during implementation, STOP and create a formal story file.
   **ADR trigger (any tier):** record an ADR (`/adr`) when a change introduces/replaces an external dependency, alters a contract used in 3+ places, changes data flow or persistence, adds an architectural layer, or commits to one of several viable designs. See `/adr` for the full matrix.
7. **Disciplines are skills.** Cross-cutting methods live in `.claude/skills/` and load on trigger: `test-driven-development` (the RED→GREEN→REFACTOR discipline behind `implementer`/`test-author`), `systematic-debugging` (the method behind `debugger`/`/brownfield:bugfix`), `obsidian` (the memory vault). Agents reference the skill rather than restating it.
## Conventions
- Artifacts live in `docs/<type>/<slug>.md` (e.g. `docs/prd/payments-redesign.md`).
- Stories: `docs/stories/<NNN>-<slug>.md` (zero-padded, sequential). ADRs: `docs/adrs/<NNNN>-<slug>.md`. Postmortems: `docs/postmortems/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`. Learnings: `docs/learnings/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`.
- Agents are role nouns (`architect.md`); commands are verbs or namespaced (`/implement`, `/greenfield:prd`); skills are disciplines (`test-driven-development/`).
- **Frontmatter `description:` must follow** `[What it does] + [Use when "<trigger phrase>"] + [Do NOT use for X]`. Negative triggers prevent overlap; without them, auto-selection blurs.
## Memory vault
An Obsidian vault at `memory/` is durable cross-session memory, reached via the `obsidian` MCP server (`.mcp.json`) and the `.claude/skills/obsidian/` skill. `docs/` is the per-task handoff medium; the vault is long-term memory (linked notes, decisions-in-context, codebase gotchas). Prefer the MCP tools for vault reads/writes (frontmatter-safe, sandboxed). `/learn` writes to both: a typed artifact in `docs/learnings/` and a linked vault note. Before planning or debugging, the `learnings-researcher` agent searches both for prior lessons.
## What not to do
- Don't skip the story file for non-trivial work — it's the context container.
- Don't manually copy template content; commands handle instantiation.
- Don't write code in the architect step or design in the implementer step — keep the split clean.
- Don't bypass `/brownfield:onboard` for an unfamiliar repo.
Bias: caution over speed on non-trivial work.
## Knowledge verification chain
When a question can't be answered from this conversation alone, consult sources in this order. Stop at the first that resolves it.
1. **Codebase.** Read the files. Grep for the symbol or string.
2. **Project docs.** `docs/architecture/`, `docs/adrs/`, `REPOMAP.md`, story files, `docs/learnings/`.
3. **Context7 MCP** (`mcp__plugin_context7_context7__*`) for library/framework docs. Prefer this over guessing — knowledge cutoffs are real.
4. **Web search / fetch.** Recent activity, community signal, breaking changes.
5. **Flag as uncertain and ask the user.** Always an option. Uncertainty beats fabrication.
Applies especially to `analyst`, `tech-researcher`, `architect`, `debugger`.
## Sub-agent delegation matrix
The architect→editor split is one instance of a broader rule: delegate context-heavy or parallelizable work; keep judgment in main context.
| Delegate to a sub-agent | Keep in main context |
|---|---|
| Research / library comparison (returns: shortlist + tradeoff) | Planning, sequencing, prioritization |
| Implementation against a fixed plan (returns: diff) | Task creation, story decomposition |
| Parallel reviews (returns: tagged findings) | Validation of those findings against original intent |
| Repo mapping (returns: REPOMAP.md) | Architectural decisions that depend on it |
| Debugging spike (returns: reproduction + root cause) | The fix decision and the test design |
Sub-agents get their full prompt in the invocation — they can't see this conversation. State the goal, constraints, inputs, expected output shape, and where to write artifacts.
## Rules
**1 — Think before coding.** State assumptions explicitly. Ask rather than guess. Push back when a simpler approach exists. Stop when confused.
**2 — Simplicity first.** Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative. No abstractions for single-use code.
**3 — Surgical changes.** Touch only what you must. Match existing style; don't refactor what isn't broken. Remove imports/variables/functions YOUR changes orphaned. Don't delete pre-existing dead code unless asked. Every changed line traces to the request.
**4 — Goal-driven execution.** Define success criteria. Loop until verified. Strong criteria let Claude loop independently.
**5 — Use the model only for judgment calls.** Use for classification, drafting, summarization, extraction. NOT for routing, retries, deterministic transforms. If code can answer, code answers.
**6 — Token budgets are not advisory.** Per-task ~4,000 tokens; per-session ~30,000. Approaching budget → summarize and start fresh. Surface the breach; don't silently overrun.
**7 — Surface conflicts, don't average them.** If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent / more tested), explain why, flag the other for cleanup.
**8 — Read before you write.** Before adding code, read exports, immediate callers, shared utilities. If unsure why existing code is shaped a certain way, ask.
**9 — Tests verify intent, not just behavior.** A test must encode WHY behavior matters, and must fail when business logic changes. Not a passing test: one that is skipped, asserts something always-true (`expect(true).toBe(true)`), matches 0 cases, or has a placeholder body. "Tests pass" is false if any shipped test is one of these. (See the `test-driven-development` skill.)
**10 — Checkpoint, and plan before multi-step work.** Before a multi-step change, emit a short `PLAN:` block (numbered steps, each with how it'll be verified) and proceed unless redirected. After each significant step, summarize what's done, verified, and left. Don't continue from a state you can't describe back.
**11 — Match the codebase's conventions, even if you disagree.** Conformance > taste inside the codebase. If a convention is harmful, surface it; don't fork silently.
**12 — Fail loud.** "Completed" is wrong if anything was skipped silently. "Tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped. Surface uncertainty; don't hide it.
